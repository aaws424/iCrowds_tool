# Adding Agents - Quick Guide

## Agent Group Setup

### Adding Agent Groups
- Create agent groups to organize different character types
- Each group can contain multiple agent variations

### Provided Agents
- **Pre-made Agents**: Use our ready-to-use characters
- **Customization**:
  - Change Clothes: Swap clothing and appearance
  - Change Action: Modify animations and behaviors
  - Include All: Apply changes to entire group

### Custom Agents
- **Requirements**:
  - Must be animated meshes using armatures or any other way
  - Single object only (join all character parts together)

### Input Options
- **Single Object**: One animated character mesh
- **Collection**: Multiple animated meshes as a group

### Agent Settings
- **Gender Control**: Male/Female classification
- **Probability**: 0.500 - Controls spawn likelihood
- **Density**: Overall agent distribution control

### Management Tools
- **Include/Discard**: Add or remove agents from simulation
- **Weight Paint**: Use vertex groups for density control
- **Customize Individual Agents**: Modify specific agents (e.g., man1)

## Workflow
1. **Create Agent Group**
2. **Choose Provided or Custom Agents**
3. **Adjust Probability and Density**
4. **Customize Appearance and Animations**
5. **Use Weight Painting for Area Control**

**Note**: Custom agents must be single joined objects with proper armature animations for best results.
