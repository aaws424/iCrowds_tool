A: Agents have needs (hunger, sleep, fun, bladder) and pathfind to nearest relevant activities when needs get low.</p> <p>Q: What's the difference between walk and run speeds? A: Below walk speed = idle, between walk/run = walking animation, above run speed = running animation.</p> <p>Q: How does pathfinding detail affect performance?

Use lower values for large scenes.</p>"},{"location":"extra/faq/#fluid-system","title":"Fluid System","text":"<p>Q: How do flow curves work? A: Agents follow curve tangents.

A: Prepare animated meshes with armatures, then add them through the custom agents panel in any system.</p> <p>Q: What does the seed parameter do? A: It ensures reproducible random patterns.
